    2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
    3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
    4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc. Your answer should use headings:

Remember, a team member's particular expertise may not be needed for this task, and some members can cooperate with some of others to complete the work more effectively. Make more cooperations.

You can make a preliminary plan by following these steps:
