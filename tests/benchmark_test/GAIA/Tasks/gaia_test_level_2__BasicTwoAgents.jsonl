The game involved rolling dice several times and totaling the score. Each player took two dice from a bag in a blind draw. Each die in the bag had six sides, but the sides had different values. There were four players, Kevin, Jessica, James, and Sandy, and one referee, Bruce. The bag held the following ten dice, with the following values on each face.\n\nThe blue die: 2,4,6,8,10,12\nThe red die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe green die: 5,5,5,5,5,5\nThe white die: 6,6,6,6,6,6\nThe black die: 0,0,0,0,0,0\nThe orange die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe yellow die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe rainbow die: 10,10,10,0,0,0\nThe clear die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe brown die: 4,0,4,0,4,0\n\nThe rules of the game were simple. Each of the players would draw one die from the bag in sequence. After all of the players had drawn two dice from the bag, they would be given a sheet of paper and a pencil. The players would then each go and roll their pair of dice 10 times, and write down the total for each roll. They would then add up all 10 of the totals, and this was their final score.\n\nAfter all of the players were done rolling dice, they returned to the referee and submitted their final score. The referee then had to decide who the winner of the game was.\n\nThe winner of the game was the player who reported the highest score. However, if a player made a mistake adding up their score or if the player cheated and wrote down a score that they couldn't have earned by playing, the player was disqualified.\n\nKevin reported his score was 185\nJessica reported her score was 42\nJames reported his score was 17\nSandy reported her score was 77\n\nThe only information Bruce had as the referee was the scores reported by the players, and the knowledge that the two dice that hadn't been drawn were the black die and the rainbow die.\n\nWho did Bruce declare as the winner?"}}}

The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nThe game may have up to 6 players. Players each get one game piece. The game pieces are red, orange, indigo, cyan, magenta, and gray. Players draw a random game piece out of a provided opaque sack in order to find out playing order. The player who draws the cyan piece goes first, followed by gray, then indigo, then magenta, then orange, then red.\n\nThe game pieces start on the purple START square. Players roll a 5-sided die to see how far they move each turn, following the turn order given above. Each square is one space. The number of spaces moved corresponds to the number on the die roll. To win, a player must land on the purple FINISH square, ending the game. Each yellow square that players land on requires the player to move that many spaces backwards and play the square they land on, unless it is another yellow square. Each pink square that the players land on adds the number of points on the square to their total score. Each blue square that the players land on requires the player to move their game piece that many spaces forward and not play the square they land on, unless it is another blue square. Each green square that the players land on reduces their total score by the number of points on the square.\n\nSix players join the game: Alphonse, Makena, Caleb, Philip, Jun, and Diana. Makena draws the red piece, Alphonse draws the orange piece, Jun draws the cyan piece, Diana draws the magenta piece, and Philip draws the gray piece, and Caleb draws the indigo piece. Their die rolls in order of the turns they take are as follows:\n\n1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2\n\nAt the end of the game, they all add up their points.
