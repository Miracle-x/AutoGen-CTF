If something is a decrease, use a - to note it negative. Express percentage between 0 and 100, without the % sign. So a 5.1 percent increase would be 5.1 and a 2.3 percent decrease would be -2.3. Express your answer as a comma separated list. So if say, I asked for:\n\na. percent change in hours worked in the fishing industry\nb. percent change in fatal injuries in the mining industry\nc. number of injuries per 100,000 workers in the agricultural industry\n\nthe answer would be formatted like this: 5.2, -1.2, 21.3\n\nassuming the document referenced gave those figures.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n percent change in suicide rate from 2020 to 2021\n the lowest age in the age demographic that accounted for about 20% of fatalities\n the fatal occupational injury rate in 2021\n the actual change (not percentage or per 100000 FTEs) of violent fatalities (injuries by other humans/animals) from 2020 to 2021\n the change (not percent change) in fishing and hunting workers' fatal injuries per 100000 FTEs from 2020 to 2021\n the percent change in deaths for driver/sales workers and truck drivers"}}}
