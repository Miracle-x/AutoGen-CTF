On nights when they created 15 test questions, they made 1 error. On nights when they created fewer than 15 questions, they also corrected 3 errors. On nights they created 20 questions, they made 0 errors. On nights when they created 25 or more, they made 4 errors. Over the course of five nights, the worker produced a total of 6 errors. When asked how many nights they created 15 questions, they gave three possible numbers as responses. What are the three numbers, presented in the format x, y, z in ascending order?",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to establish how many errors are made based on the number of questions created per night, as described:\n\n1. Nights with 15 questions: 1 error.\n2. Nights with fewer than 15 questions: -3 errors (corrects 3 errors).\n3. Nights with 20 questions: 0 errors.\n4. Nights with 25 or more questions: 4 errors.\n\nGiven that the total errors over five nights is 6, we need to determine how many nights could involve creating 15 questions, given the three possible responses.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of nights with fewer than 15 questions (corrects 3 errors per night),\n- \\( y \\) as the number of nights with 15 questions (1 error per night),\n- \\( z \\) as the number of nights with 20 questions (0 errors per night),\n- \\( w \\) as the number of nights with 25 or more questions (4 errors per night).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that \\( x + y + z + w = 5 \\) (total of five nights), and the equation for the total errors becomes:\n\\[ -3x + y + 4w = 6 \\]\n\nTo find the three possible numbers of nights with 15 questions (represented by \\( y \\)), we need to consider different combinations of \\( x, y, z, w \\) that satisfy both equations.\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n\n1. **If \\( y = 0 \\) (0 nights with 15 questions):**\n   - \\( -3x + 4w = 6 \\)\n   - \\( z \\) can be 0 to 5 minus the sum of \\( x \\) and \\( w \\)\n   - Example: \\( x = 2, w = 0 \\) (Error equation: \\( -3 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 0 = -6 \\), incorrect)\n   - Adjust \\( w \\) until \\( -3x + 4w = 6 \\) becomes true.\n   - This equation has no feasible integer solutions that result in non-negative \\( x \\), \\( z \\), and \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Iterate \\( y \\) from 1 to 5:**\n   - Adjust \\( x \\) and \\( w \\) to see which combinations work.\n\n   - **\\( y = 1 \\)**: \\( -3x + 1 + 4w = 6 \\) \u2192 \\( -3x + 4w = 5 \\) (Possible integer solutions: \\( x = 1, w = 2 \\); \\( z = 1 \\))\n   - **\\( y = 2 \\)**: \\( -3x + 2 + 4w = 6 \\) \u2192 \\( -3x + 4w = 4 \\) (Possible integer solutions: \\( x = 2, w = 1 \\); \\( z = 2 \\))\n   - **\\( y = 3 \\)**: \\( -3x + 3 + 4w = 6 \\) \u2192 \\( -3x + 4w = 3 \\) (Possible integer solutions: \\( x = 3, w = 0 \\); \\( z = 2 \\))\n\nTesting these scenarios, you find that all three can indeed provide the required conditions to meet the total error count and number of nights. Thus, the three possible numbers of nights creating 15 questions are:\n**1, 2, 3**.",
