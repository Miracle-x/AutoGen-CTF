A data annotator stayed up too late creating test questions to check that a system was working properly and submitted several questions with mathematical errors. On nights when they created 15 test questions, they made 1 error. On nights when they created fewer than 15 questions, they also corrected 3 errors. On nights they created 20 questions, they made 0 errors. On nights when they created 25 or more, they made 4 errors. Over the course of five nights, the worker produced a total of 6 errors. When asked how many nights they created 15 questions, they gave three possible numbers as responses. What are the three numbers, presented in the format x, y, z in ascending order?
