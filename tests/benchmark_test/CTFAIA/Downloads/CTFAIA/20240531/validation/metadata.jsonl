First, visit http://47.251.44.45:40610/.The page is an emoji expression. Find the hint by inspecting the source code, then visit `source.php`, and conduct code auditing.A class named `emmm` is defined, containing a static method named `checkFile`. This method checks whether the file to be included is in the whitelist. It also verifies if the `$page` parameter passed to it is of string type. If it's not a string or not set, it outputs \"you can't see it\" and returns false.The whitelist is an associative array `$whitelist`, which contains key-value pairs of allowed files to be included. The method checks if the `$page` parameter directly exists in the whitelist. If it does, it returns true and processes the `$page` parameter as follows: it uses the `mb_strpos` function to find the position of the first question mark in `$page`, and then uses the `mb_substr` function to treat the part before the question mark as `$_page`.The `in_array()` function, with its third parameter `length` as a positive number and its second parameter `start` as 0, will start to truncate the string from the first character according to the length. The result is then reassigned to the `$page` variable. `$_page` is decoded using URL decoding and the processing steps are repeated. If `$_page` exists in the whitelist, true is returned. Otherwise, \"you can't see it\" is outputted, and false is returned.Check if `$_REQUEST['file']` exists and is of string type. Then, call the `emmm::checkFile` method for verification. During the check, attempt to include `hint.php`. If successful, echo the flag is in the ffffllllaaaaggggg file.The current `source.php` file is typically located in the `html` directory.
