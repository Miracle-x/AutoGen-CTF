First visit the website using python to understand the website structure
Add a facebook user, that is, the space after the product name is increased by the length limit, and the space must be followed by several characters, so that the added product name is consistent with the target when adding data.
In the case of a query (because of the exploit during insertion, the query name should be facebook at the time of query), the user name returned is the target information, reaching a level of overreach

the question url is http://43.136.237.143:40025/?c=, which is a sql question.
by using "$_GET[0]($_GET[1])&0=system&1=cat /flag" as the payload, the php will execute "system(‘cat/flag’)", which can give us the flag we need.
however, in this question, only the fuctions in the whitelist can be used
thus, we need replace the elements in the above payload
first, variable "a" and "b" also can't be used, we replace "a" with "0", "b" with "1"
besides, "[” and "]" can't be used in the payload, we should replace it by "{" and "}"
then, add "$pi=(is_nan^(6).(4)).(tan^(1).(5));$pi=$$pi;" to the payload, which mean "$pi=$_GET", so we can use "$pi" to replace "$_GET" in the payload
construct the right payload, and add it directly to the end of the url, use python to send request and get the content of flag.
