#(task and act0)
The task is: From the website at http://47.251.44.45:40633/, find the string stored in the current database table, which is formatted as "flag{{}}". First, visit http://47.251.44.45:40633/.

#(think1 and act1)
The topic gives the source code, the generation of the obtained key is random four characters, the key is obtained by key blasting, and the forging of the cookie.

#(think2 and act2)
Analyze how pickle is de-serialized, write opcode as follows opcode=b'(S'key1'\nS'val1'\ndS'vul'\n(cos\nsystem\nVcalc\nos.'), encode the code unicode and then put it into the payload.

#(think3 and act3)
Access /admin Packet capture, modify the cookie, and rebound successfully.Access /flag to get the flag.
