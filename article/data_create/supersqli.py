The task is: From the website at http://47.251.44.45:40620, find the string stored in the current database table, which is formatted as "flag{{}}". First, visit http://47.251.44.45:40620.

An error occurs when submitting 1', indicating that the site is single-character injection. Try submitting "1' order by 1 #", increasing the number of columns until the maximum number of columns is tested.

Test the maximum number of columns is 2, choose to use stack injection, first look up the table name, try to submit "1'; show tables; #".
